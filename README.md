# Quantum Algorithm Simulations with Qiskit

This repository contains Python simulations of foundational quantum algorithms using Qiskit:

- Deutsch's Algorithm
- Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm
- Berstein-Vazarani Algorithm
- Shor's Algorithm
- Grover's Algorithm

The code is adapted from Qiskit tutorials and has been extended for experimentation and learning purposes. 
A couple of the files are not related to algorithms and are only there for the syntax of Qiskit.
Each file may contain notes for my future reference.
