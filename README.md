# Quantum Algorithm Simulations with Qiskit

This repository contains Python simulations of quantum algorithms using Qiskit:

- Deutsch's Algorithm
- Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm
- Berstein-Vazarani Algorithm
- Simon's Algorithm
- Shor's Algorithm
- Grover's Algorithm

The code is adapted from Qiskit tutorials and has been extended for experimentation and learning purposes. https://github.com/Qiskit/textbook/tree/main
A couple of the files are not related to algorithms and are only there for learning the syntax of Qiskit.
Each file contain notes for my future reference.
